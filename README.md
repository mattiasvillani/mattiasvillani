### Welcome to my little GitHub corner

I am a Professor of Statistics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se) and [Linköping University](https://liu.se).\
I teach and do research in Bayesian statistics, often with a focus on prediction and computational aspects.\
I like to keep all my teaching material, including sources files, open, so you will find repos for all my courses here (or at [STIMA@LiU](https://github.com/STIMALiU/).
