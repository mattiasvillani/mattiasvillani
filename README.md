### Welcome!

I am Professor of Statistics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se).\
I teach and do research in Bayesian statistics, often with a focus on prediction and computational aspects.\
I keep all my teaching material open, including source files, and I have repos for all my courses (older courses at [STIMA@LiU](https://github.com/STIMALiU/)).\
More info about my work on my [web pages](https://mattiasvillani.com).
