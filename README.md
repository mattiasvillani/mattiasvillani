### Welcome!

I am a Professor of Statistics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se) and [Link√∂ping University](https://liu.se).\
I teach and do research in Bayesian statistics, often with a focus on prediction and computational aspects.\
I keep all my teaching material, including source files, open, and you will find repos for all my courses here (older courses at [STIMA@LiU](https://github.com/STIMALiU/)).\
More info about my work on my [web pages](https://mattiasvillani.com).
